My first HTML/CSS/JS project

After going through some tutorials in Codeacademy, Dash and some other, I decided to practice my HTML/CSS/JS skills.

This is a HAL 9000 desk, taken from the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey". 
Currently it's only interactivity is the button below the Hal 9000 unit, which recreates some of the dialog from the movie.

What to improve:
Responsiveness
Add animations to crt screens
Separate JS, CSS and HTML into different files
???
